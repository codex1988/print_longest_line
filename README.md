Exercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will
correctly print the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as 
possible of the text.

Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line
of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s.
Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.
